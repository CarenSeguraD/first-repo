# vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# name[start : end]
# print(vowels[0 : 3])
# Output:
# ['a', 'e', 'i']
# ---------------------------------------
# Get the slice in reverse order
# If you want to print elements from the end backward, you must include a negative step:
# print(vowels[-1:-3:-1])

# sequence[start:stop:step]
# The start is inclusive
# The stop is exclusive (i.e., the element at that index is not included)
# The step determines the direction and stride of the slice
